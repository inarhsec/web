For example:\\r\\n   ```python\\r\\n   from pythermalcomfort.models import pmv_ppd_iso\\r\\n   result = pmv_ppd_iso(tdb=[22, 25], tr=25, vr=0.1, rh=50, met=1.4, clo=0.5, model=\'7730-2005\')\\r\\n   print(result.pmv)\\r\\n   print(result.ppd)\\r\\n   ```  \\r\\n   This change enhances readability and usability, especially when working with multiple outputs.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Updated Function Names and Organization**\\r\\n   - PMV functions are now named consistently (e.g., `pmv_ppd_ashrae`, `pmv_ppd_iso`).\\r\\n   - Psychrometric functions have been moved to `utilities.py` for better organization.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. **Array as inputs**  \\r\\n   All functions now accept arrays as inputs, enabling faster batch processing of multiple inputs.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. **Enhanced Documentation and Testing**\\r\\n   - More examples and detailed descriptions of models.\\r\\n   - Added input validation to ensure inputs are within model applicability limits.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. **New Features**\\r\\n   - Added surveys to assess thermal comfort in the documentation.\\r\\n   - Included a detailed section on clothing insulation.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## **How to Get Started**\\r\\nUsing pythermalcomfort v3.0 is easier than ever. \\r\\nHere\u2019s a simple example to calculate PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) using the ISO 7730 standard:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nfrom pythermalcomfort.models import pmv_ppd_iso\\r\\n\\r\\n# Input parameters\\r\\nresult = pmv_ppd_iso(tdb=[22, 25], tr=25, vr=0.1, rh=50, met=1.4, clo=0.5, model=\'7730-2005\')\\r\\n\\r\\n# Access results\\r\\nprint(\\"PMV:\\", result.pmv)\\r\\nprint(\\"PPD:\\", result.ppd)\\r\\n```  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis example demonstrates how straightforward it is to perform thermal comfort calculations with pythermalcomfort.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## How to Cite pythermalcomfort\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are using pythermalcomfort please cite the package as follows: Tartarini, F., Schiavon, S., 2020. pythermalcomfort: A Python package for thermal comfort research.

The app not only allows people to calculate a personalised heat health risk but also provides detailed recommendations on how to implement low-cost and simple science-based effective cooling strategies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile our application is free to use, some of the most vulnerable groups may not be able to access our application using a smartphone, hence, we are also planning to display the HeatWatch on public displays in community centres, libraries, police stations, etc. This will enable us to reach some of the most vulnerable groups. The public display version of the application can be accessed using this [link](https://heatwatch.sydney.edu.au/display).\\r\\n\\r\\n[Here is a 45-second video](https://youtu.be/liyCFwcNpGY) about our project which summarises our aim and objectives.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial thanks to [Ollie Jay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ollie-jay-793a1b11/) the director of the [Heat and Health Research Incubator](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/our-research/research-centres/heat-and-health-research-incubator.html) at the University of Sydney."}]}}')}}]);
